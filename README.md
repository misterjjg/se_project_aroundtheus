# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro

**Intro**

This is project 3 of the Practicum course that includes features such as flexboxes, grids, media queries, and more. The page created is meant to be responsive from a desktop to a mobile device. All functionality of the page should work the same no matter the screen size and should not become distorted.

**Features**

- Flexbox
- Grids
- Flat BEM
- Media Queries

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
